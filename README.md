Calvert's LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! This repository is dedicated to sharing my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems as I progress in my journey to become a better programmer. Each solution is documented to help both myself and others understand the intricacies of different programming challenges.


Introduction
This repository serves as my personal space to document and track my progress on LeetCode. It includes solutions in primarily focusing on Python. The solutions cover a wide range of topics including algorithms, data structures, and computer science fundamentals.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized by categories corresponding to LeetCode topics, such as:

Arrays & Hashing

Two Pointers

Stack

Sliding Window

Linked List

Binary Search

Trees

Tries

Heap/ Priority Queue 

Backtracking


Each category contains solutions that are named by the problem number followed by the problem title, for example:

001_Two_Sum

002_Add_Two_Numbers
